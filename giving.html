If you're reading this, I’m guessing things feel heavier than usual.
Maybe you're tired. Maybe you're frustrated. Maybe you're quietly thinking, “What’s the point?”
First, pause. <br>
You are allowed to feel exhausted. <br>
You are allowed to feel stuck. <br>
You are allowed to not have everything figured out. <br>
But giving up? That’s not you.
I’ve seen you when things were hard. You don’t always talk about it, but you endure. You adapt. You try again,even when nobody notices. <br>
This is just a phase. It will pass eventually.
You don’t have to solve everything right now.
You don’t have to suddenly “get it together.”
Life is supposed to be messy sometimes.
Take small steps. One thing at a time,even if it’s a very small thing.
And if everything feels pointless right now, let me be your reason to keep going for a little while.
Because my world is genuinely better with you in it.
<br>
“You are allowed to pause. Not disappear.”
            <br><br>
            I know things are tough right now, but remember that you aren't alone. 
            You've got this.
        </p>
        <p>Always here,<br>— R</p>
