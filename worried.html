        <h1>Hey Love,</h1>
        <p>
            I know thinking about the future is scary as hell.
Comparing ourselves with each and every person because we’re stuck somewhere,it just doesn’t feel right.
That feeling of being behind…but you know, everyone feels like that. There’s this quote, “Life is a race.” Sanjana keeps reminding me of that, and I keep telling her, Fuck it, there’s no race. And even if there is, I’m not a part of it.
It’s not like escaping the matrix. This is just me telling myself everything has its own pace. Everything will fall into place with time, and after that, we’ll be alright!.
You just have to keep going.
We’re not failing, we are trying.
You just need the courage to take the next step. <br>
And you know, there’s this Steve Jobs quote I live by: <br>
“You can’t connect the dots looking forward,you can only connect them looking backwards.”
<br>
Everything will fall into its place.
<br>
And there’s one more:
<br>
“Stay hungry, stay foolish.”

            <br><br>
            And wherever you end up, I just hope you’re proud of yourself.
I already am.
        </p>
        <p>Always here,<br>— R</p>
